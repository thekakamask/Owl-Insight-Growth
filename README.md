## Key objectives

This section outlines the main objectives of the project:

- Development of a comprehensive indicator:  
Create an aggregate financial indicator using key financial ratios. This indicator will serve as a cornerstone for evaluating and ranking investment opportunities, providing a clear and precise metric for assessing the financial health and growth potential of companies.

- Data collection and analysis:  
Conduct extensive financial data collection from a wide range of companies, sourcing, gathering, and consolidating historical financial data to build a robust dataset. Thorough analysis will be performed to validate the accuracy and relevance of the data, ensuring that the analysis is based on accurate and comprehensive information.

- Backtesting:  
Validate the effectiveness of the financial indicator through historical testing by applying the indicator to past data to assess its predictive power and reliability. This process helps in optimizing the indicator's parameters, ensuring its accuracy and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

- Application development:  
Build a dedicated application to implement the financial indicator, featuring an intuitive user interface and backend algorithms to calculate the indicator scores. This application will enable users to efficiently analyze investment opportunities using the comprehensive financial indicator.

- Identification of promising investments:  
Utilize the financial indicator to identify and rank the most promising investment opportunities, generating a ranked list of potential investments. This objective focuses on leveraging the indicator to make informed investment decisions, aiming to maximize returns and minimize risks.

- Risk management:  
Implement risk assessment tools and strategies within the financial indicator and the application, identifying potential investment risks, evaluating their impact, and developing mitigation strategies. This ensures the protection of client investments by proactively managing risks and minimizing potential losses.
